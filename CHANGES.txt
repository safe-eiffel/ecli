!!!	* ECLI_VALUE.as_string now *replaces* ECLI_VALUE.to_string to ensure .NET compatibility
	* Transaction isolation read/write implemented by 
	  ECLI_SESSION.transaction_isolation and ECLI_SESSION.set_transaction_isolation
	* ECLI_TIMESTAMP.decimal_digits is now 0, unless specifically set through ECLI_TIMESTAMP.set_decimal_digits
	* Prepared migration of ECLI to .NET : created support for external values
	  with classes XS_C_*; This prevents using the '$' operator.
	* Query assistant heavily reworked, still in alpha state.
	
2003-03-10
	* ECLI_VALUE descendants implement correct 'copy' and 'is_equal' features.	  
	
2003-02-28
	* 'metadata' cluster provides various cursors on metadata : tables, columns, types, procedures,
	  primary keys, foreign keys, data sources, ...

	* clisql now is a real command line interactive sql, useful in production environments
	
!!!	* ECLI_VALUE and its heirs have been revisited.  ECLI_GENERIC_VALUE [G] is a proper descendant
	  with feature 'item' that can be expanded or not.  If 'item' is a reference, it always is the
	  same reference -> beware of aliasing problems.
	                  **** WARNING **** 
	                  *****************
	  ECLI_VALUE descendants 'item' features that return a reference
	  always return the SAME reference. BEWARE OF ALIASING PROBLEMS.
	  THIS IS A MAJOR CHANGE with respect to THE PREVIOUS SEMANTICS.
	
	* Reviewed sample applications :
		'test1' does not use manifest arrays anymore (to prevent runtime problems with SmartEiffel)
		'test_rowset' has been revisited to show how error handling could be done; more useful messages.
		'isql' has been renamed 'clisql' to prevent name clashes with other known tools.
		'test_values' can check good behavior of ECLI_VALUE and ECLI_ARRAYED_VALUE heir classes
	* ECLI_ROWSET_MODIFIER : preconditions reviewed, various bug fixes
	* STRING.append usage has been dropped; using ELKS feature 'append_string' now.
	
2003-01-01
	* Added ECLI_SESSION.is_bind_arrayed_results_capable + updated ECLI_ROWSET_CURSOR preconditions on 'open' and 'open_prepared'
	* Corrected problem with ECLI_STATEMENT.parameters_count when there were parameters without name
	* ECLI_ARRAYED_VALUE.set_null is now correctly redefined
	* ECLI_ARRAYED_BUFFER_FACTORY.value_factory is not a 'once' function anymore.  It is now a simulated "once per object".
	* ECLI_ROWSET_CURSOR.row_count is bound and updated within 'fetch_next_row'.  GC is temporarily disabled to avoid problems with moving GCs.
	* Various pre/post-conditions fixed/updated
	
2002-09-28
	* Added 'arrayed' operations (ECLI_ROWSET_CURSOR, ECLI_ROWSET_MODIFIER)
	  and values (ECLI_ARRAYED_VALUE and descendants)
	* Reviewed parsing of SQL to find parameters.
	* X/OPEN CLI/ODBC constants are now defined in Eiffel constant classes
	  see $ECLI/src/spec/constants
	* class ECLI_TYPE_CODES renamed ECLI_TYPES_CONSTANTS
	* usage of ELKS STRING.keep_head
	
2001-09-15
	* TEST1 now traces its output if asked on the command line.
	* SmallEiffel-build systems now report error messages (error fixed).
 
2001-09-06
	* ISQL implementation of COMMIT, ROLLBACK and BEGIN.
		TODO: read until _eof_ or quit

2001-08-31
	* Port to Visual Eiffel 3.2 Linux
	* Added Trace capability : output can be read and executed by ISQL
	* Tested with PostgreSQL 7.1.3 and UnixODBC 2.0.9
	* Added ISE5.0/Borland makefile for C glue library
	* Fixed problem with SmallEiffel : getting error messages is now possible

2001-08-26
	* added makefile for ISE5/Borland in %ECLI%\src\spec\ise\windows
	* isql now executes commands ended by ; no need for a ; as the first and
	  single character on a line.

2001-07-19
	* is_transaction_capable, ECLI_TRANSACTION_CAPABILITY_CONSTANTS

2001-05-11
	* attach/release are now obsolete, use open/close instead
	* port to Visual Eiffel 3.2
	* updated tutorial
	* usage of GOBO 2.0 and its time cluster : DT_DATE, DT_TIME, DT_DATE_TIME
	
2000-11-03
	* fixed segmentation violation problems
	* added features 'attach' and 'release' to ECLI_SESSION and ECLI_STATEMENT
	* updated tutorial

2000-10-14
	* added a tutorial - tutorial.html

2000-09-06

	* eclibuild.sh	- Helps compile projects using SmallEiffel on Unix
	* all examples applications have been revisited
	
2000-08-10
	* ECLIBUILD.BAT - Helps compile projects that use ECLI and SmallEiffel
	* test_Xaction	- Exercises transaction capabilities
	* added support for LONGVARCHAR, in memory (no stream).

** ECLI 0001 Beta 5 **

   !!!  Query assistant - 'Query Assistant' for ECLI allows a developer to generate classes
	that encapsulate a cursor on a SQL 'SELECT' query.
     +  Structure reorganization
     +  Refactoring (contracts, anchored types, ...)

2000-07-30
	* made some cleaning
	* updated the documentation
	* port to smalleiffel

2000-07-29
	* query_assistant tool
	* query assistant test and example

2000-07-21
	* Added 'value_anchor'.  In ECLI_STATEMENT, 'ECLI_VALUE' is replaced by 'like value_anchor'

2000-07-13
	* ECLI_VALUE 'loads' or 'puts' itself to a statement.  This will allow long data to be read/written.
		see 'read_result', 'put_parameter'
	* ECLI_VALUE 'binds' itself to a statement.
		see 'bind_as_parameter'
2000-07-07
	Changed structure of ECLI directories.

ECLI sample applications

Directory	Application name	Description
---------	----------------	-------------------------------------------------------
isql		isql			Interactive SQL
					usage: isql <data_source_name> <user> <password> [sql_file_name [echo]]
					isql works in two modes
					* interactive (no sql_file_name parameter)
					* batch : isql reads commands from file whose name is sql_file_name.
						* echo is a flag that directs isql to echo commands when they are executed.
					
test1		test1			Your first sample application : create table, 
					insert tuples, select tuples, drop table
					usage: test1 <data_source_name> <user> <password> [trace_file_name]
					* when trace_file_name parameter is used, all statements (correct or not) executed
					  by the application are traced in a file.  
					  This file can be read by isql.
					  This is a very convenient way to troubleshoot your applications.
					  That way it is possible to determine if the application logic or the SQL is wrong.
					  

test_Xaction	transact		Tests data source transaction capabilities
					usage: transact <data_source_name> <user> <password>

qa_example	qa_example		Tests 'query_assistant' generated cursor classes

test_gc		test_gc			Exercises the disposal of ECLI objects
